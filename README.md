## Introduction

This data analysis is part of the author's PhD research which was finished in 2018 when she was a visiting student at the Centre of the Built Environment, UC Berkeley.  


This repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`, this file which explains the project.
- `analysis_final.R`, the R script to run the analysis.
- `parameter_description.pdf`, the codebook that describes the variables.


## Data

The dataset used was the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II.  Data and specification document can be downloaded through the [Berkeley DASH](https://dash.berkeley.edu/stash/dataset/doi:10.6078/D1F671) or the [filter tool](http://www.comfortdatabase.com/).  A journal paper has been published to describe the [development process of the database](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325848721_Development_of_the_ASHRAE_Global_Thermal_Comfort_Database_II).  

As an collaborative effort from 64 co-authors, this database collated high-quality instrumental measurements of indoor thermal environments and their simultaneous subjective thermal comfort evaluations from thermal comfort field studies around the world. Variables stored in the database can be found in `parameter_description.pdf`.

The author downloaded the entire database but only kept the columns of interest only, but the database is too large to be uploaded onto the repository.


## Publication

This analysis has been published on the Jounal of Buiding and Environment with the title [A data-driven approach to defining acceptable temperature ranges in buildings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132319301234).  It details the full story from problem, objectives, to analyses and findings.
